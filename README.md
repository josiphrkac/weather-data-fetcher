# weather-data-fetcher
This is a simple web application that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It consists of an HTML file for the user interface, a PHP file for retrieving weather information, and a JavaScript file for interacting with the PHP file and displaying the data on a webpage.

 
To get STARTED with the Weather Data Fetcher, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine or server.

Open the config.php file and replace 'your_api_key' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

Place the project files in a directory accessible by your web server or PHP environment.

Open the HTML file in a web browser, enter the name of a city in the input field, and click the "Search" button.

The application will fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it on the webpage.

Prerequisites
PHP installed on your server or local machine.
An API key from OpenWeatherMap. Sign up at their website (https://openweathermap.org) to obtain one.
Troubleshooting
Verify that you have set up the API key correctly in the config.php file.
Ensure that your server or local environment supports PHP.
Double-check the city name for correct spelling and formatting.
